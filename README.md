- **getItemLayout**: Pre-calculated item heights for instant scrolling
- **removeClippedSubviews**: Removes off-screen views from memory
- **Batch Rendering**: Optimized batch sizes for smooth scrolling

### Search Performance
- **Debounced Input**: 300ms delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Multi-field Search**: Searches across name, company, job title, phone, and email
- **Case-insensitive**: Normalized search for better user experience

### Memory Management
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Image Optimization**: Efficient handling of contact photos
- **State Management**: Minimal re-renders with optimized state updates

## Privacy & Security

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage Only**: No cloud storage or external APIs
